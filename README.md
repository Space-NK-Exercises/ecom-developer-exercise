# Space NK Developer Exercise

In this exercise we would like you to build a recommendations carousel component purely in Vanilla JavaScript. The carousel should look similar to this [screenshot](recommendations-screenshot.png) using the recommendations [JSON](data/recommendations.json) provided. The carousel component you build should display the product title, image, brand name, price and should link to the website product detail page. Creativity is accepted but do not alter the JSON provided and please refrain from using any JavaScript libraries or frameworks.

### Requirements
* Responsive
* Clean, reusable code

This carousel makes use of the flex css property to slide through the carousel items on the page. Use of package.json, Gruntfile and SASS is also demonstrated in the project. The smoothness is achieved using the css Transition property.


1. To make the carousel work, first run following command inside /repo/trunk directory path. This will install all the dependencies for the project.
npm install
2. Run below command to create main.js and main.css files
grunt default
3. Open index.html on your browser and the carousel should build through.
