# Space NK Developer Exercise

In this exercise we would like you to build a recommendations carousel component purely in Vanilla JavaScript. The carousel should look similar to this [screenshot](recommendations-screenshot.png) using the recommendations [JSON](data/recommendations.json) provided. The carousel component you build should display the product title, image, brand name, price and should link to the website product detail page. Creativity is accepted but do not alter the JSON provided and please refrain from using any JavaScript libraries or frameworks.
