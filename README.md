# Space NK Developer Exercise

To run this app open up the `index.html` file
right click and select `open in live server`. This should open the browser displaying the carousel.

I was mindful that this task was to be completed with plain `Javascript`. Which is why i have not used jQuery or any other frameworks that would have made the task much easier.

You will notice although i have the media queries set up in CSS, i have not used them as i found it difficult to create a center focused carousel, that would be able to be achieved by margins and paddings alone. I therefore set out to try to use `window.innerWidth` to set the count to move the carousel forward and back using the screen width opposed to a singular product.

I found that leaving the application like this was the closest i would get to completing the task.

I know that i could have achieved a neater finish using the grid system, but i could not think of a way to do this without a plugin.

Thank you for your time!
